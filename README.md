# Machine Learning Car Price Estimation
In this project, our goal is to estimate the prices of cars. I have tried to find the optimal hyperparameters for each model with the help
of the ```scikit``` library.

## Dataset
Ther are some ads for the sale of cars on a site, which is provided to you in csv format. The dataset contains a number of advertisements. In this data, the title of the ad, the description of the car, the type of car (light or heavy car), the time of posting the ad, the number of images uploaded next to the ad, the performance of the car, and the year of its production are specified. Finally, there is a column related to the listed price in the ad that it will be the target of the model.

## Phases
This project has three phases:

1. Preprocessing and data observation

2. Price prediction

3. The use of aggregate models
